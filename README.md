# Fever-Detection-App-with-Adafruit-AMG8xx-Sensor-and-Kivy
Fever Detection App with Adafruit AMG8xx Sensor and Kivy built in PyCharm

This Python project utilizes the Kivy framework to create a simple application that interfaces with an Adafruit AMG88xx thermal sensor. The application continuously monitors temperature readings, updating the UI to display a "Fever Detected" warning if any temperature reading surpasses 34 degrees Celsius (temperature adjusted to 34 due to sensors inaccuracies). The code structure includes Kivy UI layout definitions and scheduling tasks for sensor data updates and warning clearances. This project was built using a Raspberry Pi, PyCharm, and an Adafruit AMG88xx sensor.
