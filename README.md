# Fever-Detection-App-with-Adafruit-AMG8xx-Sensor-and-Kivy
Fever Detection App with Adafruit AMG8xx Sensor and Kivy built in PyCharm

Project Summary: This Python project utilizes the Kivy framework to create a simple application that interfaces with an Adafruit AMG88xx infrared camera. The application continuously monitors temperature readings, updating the UI to display a "Fever Detected" warning text if any temperature reading surpasses 34 degrees Celsius (temperature threshold adjusted to 34C due to sensors inaccuracies). The code structure includes Kivy UI layout definitions and scheduling tasks for sensor data updates and warning clearances.

Key Components: 
Raspberry Pi
Jumper Wires (x3)
Adafruit AMG88xx infrared camera
Python
Kivy (Python framework)
PyCharm (IDE)
Adafruit AMG88xx Python Library

Key Features: Temperature monitoring using a Raspberry Pi and the Adafruit AMG88xx IR camera. It provides real-time temperature data display through a user-friendly graphical interface created with the Kivy Python framework. The system includes an automated fever detection mechanism, which triggers a "Fever Detected" warning message whenever the temperature reading exceeds 34 degrees Celsius. The warning message is automatically cleared after 10 seconds to maintain a clean and informative display. This project offers continuous and accurate temperature monitoring with a focus on automated fever detection for various applications.
